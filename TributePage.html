							<h1>ABOUT</h1>
							<p class="text-justify">Myles Richard Kennedy is an American musician, singer/ songwriter who is best known as
								the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of the rock band Alter Bridge. He is also the lead vocalist and rythm guitarist in Slash's soloband,
								known as Slash ft. Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators. His trademark is his impressive four-octave vocal range.</br>
							<p class="text-justify">Myles Kennedy was born as Myles Richard Bass on November 27, 1969 in Boston,
								Massachusetts, and raised in Northern Idaho and Spokane. His father, Richard Bass, died when he was four years old and his mother subsequently went
								on to marry a Methodist minister, and the family took the surname Kennedy. He found his singing voice by
								listening to his parents' Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder records, and also states that he was influenced by Robert Plant.
								After graduating in 1988, he enrolled in Spokane Falls Community College to study music.</p>

							<h2>THE MAYFIELD FOUR</h2>
							<p class="text-justify">In 1995 Myles started teaching guitar in a store called Rock City Music. In August 1996
								he became the lead vocalist and guitarist of the Mayfield Four, a rock band with his childhood friends Zia Uddin, Marty Meisner, and Craig
								Johnson. They signed a contract with Epic Records thanks to a critically acclaimed demo called Thirty Two Point Five
								Hours that the band recorded in 1996, followed by a live extended play called Motion in 1997. The Mayfield Four's
								debut album, Fallout, was supported with a fifteen-month tour with bands such as Creed, Big Wreck, and Stabbing
								Westward. Though popular, The Mayfield Four never garnered enough exposure to break into the mainstream. In 2002, the
								future of the band began to look unlikely. The band went on hiatus that year, and would ultimately disband.</p>

							<h2>ALTER BRIDGE</h2>
							<p class="text-justify">Myles Kennedy is best known as the lead vocalist and guitarist of the American hard rock
								band Alter Bridge. The band's origins lie in late 2003 when Kennedy was contacted by former Creed guitarist Mark Tremonti, who was interested
								in having Kennedy lay down vocal tracks for some songs he had recently written. Tremonti and drummer Scott
								Phillips had reunited with former bassist Brian Marshall who had left Creed in 2000 to form a new band. Alter Bridge,
								taking its name from an actual bridge that used to be located near Tremonti's home in Detroit, was officially formed
								in January 2004. Coinciding with the official announcement of Alter Bridge's formation was an announcement
								regarding their debut album, One Day Remains, along with the release of that album's lead single, "Open Your Eyes."</p>

							<p>Alter Bridge took a temporary break in early 2009 with its members working on other projects, but the band
								continued writing music throughout the year. The band regrouped later that year to begin work on their third album, AB
								III, which was released in 2010 on Roadrunner Records worldwide. Myles Kennedy chose to write lyrics based on his
								own personal experiences with faith and believing. As such, it is lyrically the band's darkest album, with Kennedy
								calling it the most personal album he had made since The Mayfield Four's Second Skin.
								<br> The band reunited in late 2012 and recorded from April to July 2013 their fourth album titled Fortress,
								which was released on September 30, 2013. The band reconvened in January 2016 and recorded their fifth album, The Last Hero, until July 2016, which
								was released on October 7, 2016.</p>

							<h2>SLASH FT. MYLES KENNEDY & THE CONSPIRATORS</h2>
							<p class="text-justify">Myles Kennedy has become very well known for his collaborations with Guns N' Roses lead
								guitarist Slash. On February 3, 2010, Slash announced that Kennedy would be the lead vocalist for his band on tour. On tour, Kennedy
								performed a number of songs found throughout Slash's catalog. The other members of Slash's band are rhythm guitarist
								Bobby Schneck (replaced as of the Apocalyptic Love tour with Frank Sidoras), bassist Todd Kerns (formerly of Age of
								Electric), and drummer Brent Fitz (formerly of Theory of a Deadman).</p>

							<p>Slash's second solo album featured Myles Kennedy, this time as the sole vocalist. As of December 2011, three
								songs had been recorded: "Halo", "Standing in the Sun", and "Bad Rain". The album "Apocalyptic Love", was released on
								May 22, 2012. The album will be billed to "Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators", featuring Kennedy,
								Kerns, and Fitz as members of Slash's band. The first single, "You're a Lie", was released to rock radio on February
								27th, 2012. The band's second collective album World on Fire is produced by Michael "Elvis" Baskette and was released
								on September 16th, 2014. The band's third album Living the Dream, again produced by Michael "Elvis" Baskette is
								scheduled for a September 21, 2018 release.</p>

							<h2>YEAR OF THE TIGER</h2>
							<p class="text-justify">Kennedy's first solo album, Year of the Tiger, was released at March 9th 2018 and
								focused almost entirely on the loss of his father. Delving into this emotional territory required a musical approach far different from the hard
								rock that has defined Kennedy’s arena-filling career. The majority of the record was written on acoustic or
								resonator guitar and recorded directly to tape using a limited number of tracks. Kennedy himself plays banjo, lap steel,
								bass, and mandolin in addition to guitar on Year of the Tiger, joined by drummer Zia Uddin and Tim Tournier on bass,
								along with longtime Alter Bridge producer Michael “Elvis” Baskette.</p>

						<div class="text-white text-justify">
							<p>The album found its initial direction from the title track, which was an idea from Kennedy’s first pass
								writing a solo album. 1974 was the year his father died and according to the Chinese Zodiac, this was the Year Of The
								Tiger. The song is really the preface for the entire story from his mother’s perspective. It’s a battle cry of
								resolution, to persevere under the circumstances they were enduring after his father passed away. Kennedy pays tribute to
								his mother throughout the album. The song “Mother” tries to imagine her experience of the tragedy, fighting to keep
								things together for Kennedy and his brother. With Year of the Tiger, Myles Kennedy opens himself up in ways that would
								be painfully, shockingly personal and intimate for anyone, much less for a revered rock and roll frontman. </p>
